# MATLAB Toolbox for a North Sea Ecosystem Baseline Assessment

A MATLAB toolbox for conducting ecological baseline assessments in support of an offshore geological CO₂ storage (GCS) project in the North Sea.

The toolbox enables:
- Processing and validation of satellite-derived datasets
- Calculation of phytoplankton phenology metrics
- Analysis of long-term ecosystem variability
- Estimation and analysis of surface-ocean “blue carbon” indicators
- Correlation analysis between ecological metrics and environmental drivers
